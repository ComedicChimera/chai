# The Book
The book is a proposed alternative to have a separate introductory guide and specification: the book would act as both a definitive reference for the language and as a learning material for new programmers.  It would be vaguely modeled after the K & R. 

The book would likely be considerable longer than the Guide by default and so should be structured in such a way that users don't have to read the whole thing to be effective and can skip around as relevant to them.

The book will have exercises; hopefully, with solutions included.
