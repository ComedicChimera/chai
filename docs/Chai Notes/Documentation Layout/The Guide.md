# The Guide: Chai in 10 Lessons
A sort of zero-to-hero guide for a new Chai developer.  We want a quick way to onboard new users and this definitely fulfills that purpose.  Inspired by the "Learn Rust in 30 Minutes" article. 

**Note:** Some core topics will be elided.  This is a quickstart guide for the new developer to get working in Chai.  To actually build real APIs, one needs to consult the book.
