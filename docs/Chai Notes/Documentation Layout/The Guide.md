# The Guide
The guide is intended to be the principle resource for learning Chai.  It is structured into a series of sequential chapters discussing both different language features and some useful standard library tooling.  Each chapter also may contain one or more exercises for the reader.  There will be a separate repository used to store solutions to these exercises.

## Chapters
**Hello World**
Covers the *Hello World* program, introduces modules and functions, and explains how to build and run programs.

*Exercises*: 
1. Modify the *Hello World* program to print *Hello Chai!* instead of *Hello World!*

**Numbers and Types**
Covers comments, types, numeric types, casting, arithmetic.

**Variables and Input**
Covers blocks, variables, assignment, input and output.

*Exercises*:
1. Write a program to multiply the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` by the sum of the other two values.
2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two integers and prints their quotient.

**Conditional Logic**
Covers booleans, relational operators, logical operator, block expression, and if/elif/else.

*Exercises*
1. Write a program that prompts the user to enter their favorite number and then display whether or not that number is even.
2. Write a simple calculator program that prompts the user to enter a simple arithmetic expression (eg. `1 + 1` or `5 - 7` -- only two numbers and an operator separated by spaces) and evaluates then displays the result of the input expression.

**Collections and Loops**
