# The Guide
**NOTE**: We are switching to a new strategy for documentation.  This document may be outdated.

The guide is intended to be the principle resource for learning Chai.  It is structured into a series of sequential chapters discussing both different language features and some useful standard library tooling.  Each chapter also may contain one or more exercises for the reader.  There will be a separate repository used to store solutions to these exercises.

## Chapters
**Hello World**
Covers the *Hello World* program, introduces modules and functions, and explains how to build and run programs.

*Exercises*: 
1. Modify the *Hello World* program to print *Hello Chai!* instead of *Hello World!*

**Numbers and Types**
Covers comments, types, numeric types, arithmetic.

**Variables and Input**
Covers blocks, variables, assignment, casting, input and output.

*Exercises*:
1. Write a program to multiply the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` by the sum of the other two values.
2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two integers and prints their quotient.

**Conditional Logic**
Covers booleans, relational operators, logical operators, block expressions, scoping and shadowing, and if/elif/else.

*Exercises*:
1. Write a program that prompts the user to enter their favorite number and then display whether or not that number is even.
2. Write a simple calculator program that prompts the user to enter a simple arithmetic expression (eg. `1 + 1` or `5 - 7` -- only two numbers and an operator separated by spaces) and evaluates then displays the result of the input expression.

**Loops**
Covers while loops, break, continue, and after.  Also includes a digression on random numbers.

*Exercises*:
1. Write a Fizz Buzz program.
2. Write a program to prompt the user to enter a list of numbers and display the maximum number entered.
4. Implement a guessing game where a random number is generated between 1 and 100 and repeatedly prompt the user to guess the number.

**Lists and Maps**
Covers lists, indexing, list methods, for loops, slicing, maps, and map methods.

*Exercises*: 
1. TODO
2. Write a program to print all the prime numbers under 1000 using the Sieve of Erastothanes.


**Strings**
Covers string manipulations, UTF-8 encoding, string indexing and slicing, string iteration, and useful string utilities.

*Exercises*:
1. Write a program to capitalize a string the user enters.
2. Write a program to prompt the user to enter a comma-separated list of numbers and print their sum. 

**Functions**
**Error Handling**
**Structs**
**Pattern Matching**
**Algebraic Types**
**References and Buffers**
**Nullability**
**Method Spaces**
**Lambdas and Closures**
**Generics**
**Operator Definitions**
**Type Classes**
**Sequences and Generators**
**Generic Control Flow**
**Packages and Modules**
**Files and Paths**
**Concurrency**
**Networking**
**System Interfacing**
