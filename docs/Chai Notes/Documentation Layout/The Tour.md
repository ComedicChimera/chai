# The Tour
The Tour will be an interactive, online walkthrough (built around the playground) that gives a basic "tutorial introduction" to Chai and its features.  It will essentially be a series of panels documenting different features paired with an exercise to help the reader practice their skills.

The Tour will be more practical than the Spec: it will skip over some details and cover features and Standard Library utilities.  

The Tour will be organized into a series of modules each of which is composed of chapters.  Each chapter will have a "lesson" and a "problem".  The goal will be to introduce a feature or set of features and then give the reader practice with those features.

### Introduction
This will introduce the premise of the tour and familiarize the user with its interface.

### Module 1: Basics
This module is a sort of crash course in the basics of the language: striving to get the user writing useful programs as fast as possible.

**Sections**:
1. Hello World
	*Lesson*: main function, importing, `println`, string basics, comments.  
	*Problem*: Modify the program to print "Hello Chai!".
2. Numbers, Variables, and Types
	*Lesson*: integers, floats, arithmetic, variables, assignment, types, casting, `scanf`.  
	*Problem*: Write a program which takes in three floating point numbers from the user, takes the product of the first two, adds the third, and converts the result to an integer.
3. Conditional Logic
	*Lesson*: booleans, comparison operators, if/elif/else, logical operators, expression blocks.
	*Problem*: TBD
4. Loops
5. Functions
6. References
7. Error Handling
