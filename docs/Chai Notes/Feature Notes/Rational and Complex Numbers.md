## Rational Numbers
The rational types provide a way to conveniently express rational numbers: ie. numbers made of a ratio between two integers.

#### Roadmap
- [ ] Add in the type labels: `r64` and `r128`
- [ ] Add in the `//` operator make an appropriate rational out of the two types
- [ ] Use the methods `numer` and `denom` to access the numerator and denominator respectively
- [ ] Add in relevant arithmetic operators
- [ ] Support casting between rational numbers and floating point numbers

## Complex Numbers
Complex numbers provide a way to conveniently express numbers that have both real and complex components.

#### Roadmap
- [ ] Add in the type labels: `c64` and `c128`
- [ ] Add in `j` notation for construction complex literals:
	- Eg. `4 + 3j`
- [ ] Add in the `real` and `imag` methods to access the real and imaginary components
- [ ] Add in relevant arithmetic operators
