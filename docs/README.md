# Chai Documentation

This directory is a place for me to put language documentation while the
official website is still MIA.  I am not working on it because the current state
of web development is an actual trainwreck, and I am trying to figure out a
workflow and toolchain that will not have me turning into a maniac -- if it's
not obvious, I am a back-end developer through and through, and building a
language website is a LOT of front-end. 

This directory will contain both documentation of the language itself and
possibly some compiler structure documentation although I have tried to make my
code, comments, and directory structure as self-documenting as possible.  One
benefit of being mildly OCD is that I tend to hyper-fixate on things naming
conventions, consistency, and organization in general.  Just open this source
file and note that ALL of the paragraphs have been wrapped to 80 characters.

Note that some (or most as of the time of writing this) of the language features
documented in this guide are not yet implemented and may be subject to change. I
am writing them down here both to keep my own language straight in my head and
to give people who don't want to pour over thousands of lines of code an idea of
what is going on here.
