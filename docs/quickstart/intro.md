# The Guide: Chai in 10 Lessons

Welcome to the Quickstart Guide!  In this guide, we will go through the
fundamentals of Chai so you can start writing useful applications as quickly as
possible.

This guide is primarily intended for experienced developers who don't have a ton
of time to spend learning a new language and just want to get the "gist" of Chai
in an hour or so.  We will go through concepts fairly quickly and several more
advanced topics will be mostly elided.

However, after reading through this guide, you should have a pretty solid grasp
of how to use Chai and will be well prepared to learn more advanced topics and
tools: it should provide you with an excellent starting point and a good
understanding of the language.

Now, without further adieu, let's get into the guide!
