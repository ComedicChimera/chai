# The Basics

In this lesson, we will cover all the basic stuff in Chai that you should come
as no surprise to a remotely experienced developer: variables, if/else,
functions, and the like.

# <a name="setting-up"> Setting Up

First things first, make sure have Chai *installed* (TODO: insert link).  That
done, you can go ahead and run the command:

    chaic -v

to make sure that it is installed and available in your path.

To get started writing code, go ahead and create a directory.  You should name
it something in all lowercase optionally including underscores: this name will
be important momentarily.

> Technically, you can name your directory anything which is a valid Chai
> identifier, but the convention is to name it in lowercase.

Finally, you can go ahead and create a file ending in `.chai`.  This will be
your first Chai source file.  Just open it up in your favorite editor, and you
are ready to go.
