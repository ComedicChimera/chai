# The Basics

This chapter of the tutorial will walk you through all the basic topics you need
to get started writing some "useful" programs.  Although it is longer, it mainly
focuses on topics most programmers are already familiar with so it shouldn't be
that much of a bear.

1. Implement a simple [Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)
   program: print the first 100 fizz-buzz numbers.

2. Write a program to print the nth Fibonacci number with `n` is given by the
   user.

3. Write a program to calculate the square root of `n` where `n` is given by the
   user using [Newton's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method).
