# string represents an array of Unicode characters.  They are used to represent
# text within the language.  Strings are encoded in UTF-8 and represented
# internally as a byte array. 
#
# NOTE: Strings appear identically to a byte buffer; however, they cannot simply
# be defined as an alias to one since buffers are mutable (and have mutation
# operators defined on them), and strings are not.
